# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market movements. It integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques with quantitative financial analysis to evaluate whether news headlines can serve as predictive signals for stock price changes.

## Project Description

The analysis is based on the Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID), which combines news headline data with corresponding stock price information.

The project includes:

- Sentiment analysis of financial news headlines
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of text and time-series data
- Calculation of technical indicators such as Moving Averages (MA), RSI, and MACD
- Computation of daily stock returns
- Statistical correlation analysis between sentiment scores and stock movements

## Objective

The primary objective is to determine whether there is a measurable relationship between news sentiment and stock performance, and to assess the potential of using sentiment-driven insights for predictive financial analysis.

## Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, TA-Lib, PyNance, TextBlob, NLTK, Matplotlib, Git
